# Gaussian_Curvature
Computational Geometry and Gaussian Curvature Analysis with Wolfram Mathematica 13.3

A project implemented in Wolfram Mathematica 13.3 that focuses on generating Bezier curves by controlling polygons. 
The dca function is used for demonstration and visualization:

(a) The Coons control grid for a given Bezier curves. 
(b) A patch of the Bezier curves associated with the above control grid.

In addition, Gaussian curvature calculations with specific parameter values 
(0.25, 0.25), (0.25, 0.75), (0.5, 0.5), (0.75, 0.25) and (0.75, 0.75) are performed for the resulting curve.
Apply the following equations to calculate the Gaussian curvature:

Encourage and combine the use of dca functions to simplify the calculation process.
